# Article 2：In the Dream of You

In dreams, you linger, so vividly near,  
A whisper of warmth in the silence.  
Thirteen moons have passed since you slipped away,  
Yet in my slumber, you choose to stay.  

I reach for your presence, I grasp at the air,  
Though waking reveals you, I find you not there.  
Back to the old house, where childhood was spun,  
Yet your spirit seems dim, your warmth nearly gone.  

A silver lid resting on the old stove,  
A cup by your side, where the memories rove.  
You nap in the chair, a soft slumber's embrace,  
I urge you to rest, to find your sweet place.  

But you sink into dreams, as the world fades away,  
A green water bottle crashes, I wake in dismay.  
The echoes of you haunt my thoughts like a song,  
In dreams, you are near, though the days feel so long.
