# Article 3: In Loving Memory of My Grandmother (English Version of Article 1)

Shi Shunlan, female, born in 1942, passed away peacefully around midnight on May 27, 2023.

Her exact date of birth remains a mystery. She once told me her true lunar birthday when I was little, but I didn’t pay much attention at the time. In recent years, whenever I asked, hoping to celebrate her birthday with her, she always avoided telling me. I do know for sure that she was born in the Year of the Horse, because ever since I can remember, she taught me to recite the Chinese zodiac rhyme and would quiz me on the zodiac and the names of every family member.  

**Marriage, She Taught Me, Is a Matter Between Two People—No One Else’s Business.**  
That was her first lesson to me. In the 1950s, it was rare for rural women to complete even primary school. In her youth, she worked as a teacher and later as an accountant for the village collective. My grandfather was the village Party Secretary. Besides their shared work background, they also had this in common: both were widowed in middle age. In the 1980s, it was not easy for two middle-aged widows and widowers to find love again. At first, neither received blessings from their families. But neither of them was a pushover. Having finally found their ideal partners in their forties, they ignored the opposition, defied their families’ objections, and got married.

## 1. A Woman with Sharp Edges

**She Never Tried to Please Everyone.**  
She had a sharp tongue and didn’t hold back, which often made her unpopular. To most, she was headstrong, domineering, blunt, and tough—a reputation that preceded her. Some local kids, upon learning that she was my grandmother, would actually avoid me. My grandfather often had to smooth things over for her in the village, only to come home and scold her—only to be immediately rebuked by her for “undermining family unity.” Over time, he learned to handle it all quietly. As a child without parents around, I was naturally more vulnerable, and Grandpa’s mediation work inevitably made him some enemies. Yet, thanks to Grandma’s formidable reputation, no one dared to bully us. But to me, she was always gentle and patient.  

**She Had Two Little Indulgences: Champagne and Smoking.**  
On fine afternoons, she would invite me to share a small glass of champagne—just 20ml each—and we would sip it together for an hour. Once or twice a month, she’d lock the front door, light a cigarette, and I would watch her curiously from across the table. She would always give me a mischievous, conspiratorial smile and remind me, “This is our little secret.”  

**An Independent Woman**  
She loved the female heroes from the radio dramas of The Yang Family Generals and the legendary Two-Gun Granny. Maybe she had a heroic dream of her own. On one hand, she handled all the household chores and ran a small poultry farm, providing the main income during my childhood. On the other hand, she was never one to live “in a shell” (a nod to Chekhov’s “The Man in a Case”). Traditional Chinese culture demanded emotional restraint at all times, much like 18th-century Europe. But she was fierce, brave in love and hate, economically self-sufficient, and intellectually independent. She refused to rely on anyone, defying the constraints of her time. Yes, there were traces of old-school values, but her spirit of independence shone through. This sense of self-awareness and rebellious spirit was especially rare and precious in her time and place.

## 2. Me and Her

**Childhood Memories**  
In my childhood memories, Grandpa was afraid of Grandma, Grandma was afraid of me, and I was afraid of Grandpa. In another sense: Grandpa loved Grandma the most; Grandma loved me the most; and I was closest to Grandma, barely interacting with anyone else. From the time I can remember until I started school at seven, I lived with them every day—mostly just me and Grandma. Other adults didn’t really talk to me like a friend. Each morning at eight, I would wake up to find that Grandma had already gathered a few neighborhood kids at our house, waiting for me to start the day. Under her watch, we’d play card games (like 5 10 K, 70253, Goji, Black A and Shengji), badminton, with toys, and watch TV. At night, when my playmates went home, Grandma and I would eat crispy rice crust together and watch dramas. Summers in Jinan were sweltering, and she would fan me with a palm-leaf fan until I fell asleep.  

**A Love Beyond Measure**  
Her love was fierce and unapologetic—sometimes even excessive, or what others might call overindulgent. Before she got sick, only I knew the hiding spots and passwords for all her savings. She once secretly sold some of my parents’ old furniture and gave me the money. Of course, this favoritism also created problems, and she must have known it. But her love was like burning all the bridges behind her—no retreat, no regrets. Yet, it never felt suffocating. She always chose to love in the way that made me feel most comfortable, rather than just doing what made her happy.  

**She Was My Soulmate, Always Team Andy.**  
From my earliest memories, she treated me like an equal, like a friend. When we disagreed, she would patiently explain her side and listen to every word I said. We shared countless little secrets. Even at four or five, when I’d burst out with wild ideas, she’d never judge me. Instead, she’d turn into my biggest cheerleader, giving me a thumbs-up and telling me, “You’re amazing! That’s such a good idea.” Then she’d solemnly promise, “You’re going to be President one day.” And she’d always back my ideas with real action. She constantly reminded me: *You are different. You are unique. You are special. You can do anything you want with your life.*  
With her encouragement, my mind grew freer and bolder. For decades, we never had a falling-out. No arguments, no fights, no resentment—just unconditional trust and support.  

**Of Course, We Didn’t Agree on Everything.**  
Our last—and only—real disagreement was about her refusing hospital care and her refusal to come live with me in Shanghai. In February 2023, she rejected the hospital, Shanghai, and even the idea of a caregiver. Then came bouts of memory loss. Maybe she didn’t want to leave her hometown. Maybe she thought I wouldn’t be able to care for her fully. Maybe she didn’t want to burden me. Maybe she just wanted to stay quietly with Grandpa. Maybe she was too tired. Maybe she had no will to fight. I’ll never know. When she was lucid, I asked for her wishes. She said she wanted no heroic measures, no aggressive treatment—she just wanted to let nature take its course at home. I didn’t expect her to leave so suddenly.

## 3. Remembering

**A Farewell to an Independent, Free Spirit**  
She had her own ideas about marriage. She had her own mind. She didn’t please everyone, but she loved me fiercely. Grandpa and Grandma shared similar personalities, while mine couldn’t be more different—she was fierce, I was gentle. But deep down, I admired her independence, her free spirit. After leaving home at eighteen, I finally reconnected with the free-spirited child I used to be: I learned ten different dance styles, spent two years as an amateur swimmer, switched from engineering to finance, dabbled in stock trading, and eventually returned to academia. Whenever I shared my wild ideas, she never asked “why.” She always transformed into that biggest cheerleader: *You are different. You are unique. You are special. You can do anything you want with your life.*  

**The Unrivaled Love of My Life**  
Grandma’s love was so fierce and unwavering that it felt like the highest expression of love itself—something I may never experience again. She was unable to have children of her own, and because she remarried my biological grandfather, that’s how our story began. She was not just my grandmother—she was my second mother, my pillar, my soulmate, and my biggest fan. For 32 years, she showed me what love truly meant: *Love is just between two people, with no one else involved; love means putting someone else’s needs above your own; love is selfless, with no expectation of return; love is about loving every part of someone, without trying to change them; love is unconditional trust—always in their corner; love can transcend biology and genetics; love, when it reaches its pinnacle, sees only the beloved.*  
We always knew we were each other’s favorite person—and even Grandpa, who had to watch this from the sidelines for 32 years, knew it too.
